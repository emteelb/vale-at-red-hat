= Integrating Vale into your Git workflow by using a GitHub Action

Integrate Vale into your GitHub content development workflow by creating a GitHub Action that uses the link:https://github.com/errata-ai/vale-action[GitHub Action for Vale].

By creating a GitHub Action workflow for Vale, you can configure how Vale runs: you can set Vale flags and specify which Git workflow events trigger Vale jobs. For example, you can decide to:

* Run Vale when a contributor creates a pull request.
* Run Vale on only the changes.
* Allow the merging of pull requests if the report has errors.
* Block the merging of pull requests if the report has errors.

For a full list of supported configuration options, see link:https://github.com/errata-ai/vale-action[Vale GitHub Action].

.Prerequisites
* Your content repository is on GitHub. For GitLab repos, see * xref:defining-a-vale-onboarding-strategy.adoc[Define a Vale CI onboarding strategy for your project].
WARNING: Because of GitHub token permissions, the Vale GitHub Action cannot post annotations to pull requests from a forked repository.
* You have defined a xref:using-vale-with-a-continuous-integration-service.adoc[] for your project.
* You have reviewed and bookmarked the official `vale-action` information at link:https://github.com/errata-ai/vale-action[errata.ai].

.Procedure

. Copy `.vale.ini` from link:https://github.com/redhat-documentation/vale-at-red-hat[vale-at-red-hat] into the root of your GitHub repository and configure your style preferences.
. In the `.github/workflows/` folder of your project repository, create a YAML file called `vale.yml`.
* *Tip*: You can also click *Actions* and use the GitHub Actions wizard to initialize the vale.yml file and validate your configuration.
. Add the following configuration to the `.github/workflows/lint-with-vale.yml` file:

[source,yaml]

          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN}}
          REVIEWDOG_GITHUB_API_TOKEN: ${{secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN}}
----

. Optional: Change the default configuration to suit the requirements of your project. For example, if you want to block PR merges when Vale errors exist, set `fail_on_error` to *true*.
. Commit and push the GitHub Action to the main branch of your GitHub repository and rebase your other branches.

.Verification

To test your GitHub Action, change or add some content files and submit a pull request to the main docs branch. Vale will run and report an expandable status summary in the PR.
